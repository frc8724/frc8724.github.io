  robotics team from Bedford, New Hampshire. FIRST (For Inspiration and
  Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international robotics
  competition designed to teach high school students important STEM concepts, as
  well as skills in leadership, teamwork, and gracious professionalism.

  In 2022 we competed in two regular season events, finishing as a semifinalist in both,
  and qualified for the New England District Championship as the highest seeded rookie team!  
</p>

<p class="text-2xl mt-10 text-center">
  Our offseason will include an additional three events: Battlecry (WPI)  in June, Governer's Cup 
  and River Rage in October.  
</p>

<p class="text-2xl mt-10 text-center">
  We also participated in community outreach events including the New Boston 4th of July Parade and Farmer's Market, 
  AerospaceFest at the McAuliffe-Sheperd Discovery Center, and WickedSTEM in 
  Milford, NH.  We are available to demonstrate our robot at your event, school, or CO-OP.
