  <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FRC</a>
  robotics team from Bedford, New Hampshire. FIRST (For Inspiration and
  Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international robotics
  competition designed to teach high school students important STEM concepts, as
  well as skills in leadership, teamwork, and gracious professionalism.

<p class="text-2xl mt-10 text-center">
  This year we were given the opportunity to show off our robot and STEM skills
  at the Thunder Over NH air show in September, where over 40,000 people were
  able to see our robot in action.

<p class="text-2xl mt-10 text-center">
  In addition, we competed in multiple off-season events such as Battlecry,
  hosted by WPI, River Rage, where we were the captain of the 6th alliance, and
  Governor's Cup, where we made it to the semifinals as the 4th seed captain.
